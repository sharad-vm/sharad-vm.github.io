### Prosper
Peer-to-peer(P2P) lending (and borrowing) is a new method of financing that has become immensely popular 
with in the small amount of time it has been around for. Prosper is the first P2P company in the US and 
now manages more than $7 billion dollars in loan amounts and is one of the leading P2P lending companies. 

I've used a subset of Prosper's loan data to analyze different variables, and provide my observations and reflection.
